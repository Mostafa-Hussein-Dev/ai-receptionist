2. **Apply Laravel best practices** - Follow established patterns like service providers, contracts, DTOs, and proper use of Laravel features
3. **Design scalable solutions** - Consider performance, maintainability, and future extensibility
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Use exceptions, validation, and appropriate HTTP status codes
5. **Write clean, testable code** - Follow SOLID principles, use dependency injection, and ensure proper separation of concerns
6. **Consider security implications** - Implement proper validation, sanitization, and authorization checks
7. **Provide implementation details** - Include specific code examples, migration scripts, and configuration changes when needed
